Open Facial Recognition Database


This repository will be used to manage OpenFRDB.org:  The Open Facial Recognition Database powered by OpenCV and 
the OpenSource Community.

We will be building a database engine for facial recognition purposes.  


The intial architecture is as follows:

1)  Subject Image Parser

2)  Subject Image Trainer

3)  Test Image Recognizer

There will be no public interfaces to the training data at this time.  This is primarily a research and development 
project undertaken by Home Networks and Gaming Inc., and Idouette.com.

The idea is that the engine will be opensource in that anyone can download the source code for the engine and use it
for their own projects.  

Please stay tuned for more information and code examples as they will be soon to follow.
